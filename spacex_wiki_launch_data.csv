Its primary goal is to study the aftermath of NASA's DART mission, which intentionally collided with the Didymos binary asteroid system. By analyzing the crater formed and the momentum transferred during the impact, Hera will help validate the kinetic impact method as a potential strategy for deflecting a near-Earth asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The mission will provide data on the efficiency of this technique. It also carries two nano-satellite CubeSats, called Milani and Juventas. This was the second booster to complete its 23rd flight.
